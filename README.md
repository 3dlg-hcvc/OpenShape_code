Official code of "OpenShape: Scaling Up 3D Shape Representation Towards Open-World Understanding".

Code is coming soon, stay tuned!

Left: Zero-shot 3D shape classification on the Objaverse-LVIS (1,156 categories) and ModelNet40 datasets (40 common categories). Right: Our shape representations encode a broad range of semantic and visual concepts. We input two 3D shapes and use their shape embeddings to retrieve the top three shapes whose embeddings are simultaneously closest to both inputs.
